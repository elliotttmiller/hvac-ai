i need you to take our official, fully optimized, specialized and advanced GPU Autodistill pipeline notebook (ai_model/notebooks/autodistill_hvac_grounded_sam2.ipynb) and properly / optimally, revise and optimize the entire pipeline end to end. creating a new separate notebook ( ai_model/notebooks/autodistill_hvac_pipeline_CPU.ipynb) strictly for CPU environments only and leave our existing GPU environment notebook untouched.
